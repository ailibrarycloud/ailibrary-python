# OFFICIAL AILIBRARY REPO

questions so far:
1) various versions? should i have a src/ailibrary/v1/ ?
2) how to organize the package? for example in src/ailibrary/ should i have various modules like agent.py, utilities.py, etc, where each module contains the apis for that entity? or should it be like src/ailibrary/agent/function\_1.py, src/ailibrary/agent/function\_2.py, src/ailibrary/utilities/function\_1.py, src/ailibrary/utilities/function\_2.py
3) global variables? domain name, version name, etc?
4) CI/CD?
